# Project-Ignis-HD-Cards

This contains all the HD Card images for Project Ignis / EDOpro to date.

How to install? ***[Make Sure EDO is not running, to avoid conflicts.]***

1. When updating, it is best practice to delete the files in the "\ProjectIgnis\pics" folder first.
2. Download the .zip file by clicking [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/prsts60h1b0a39v/pics.zip/file) or [here](https://mega.nz/file/HI0WHA5Y#PcaRDOhjP3k7P7H9eO_DJAkDHJDnhEgPJvKbBiULLcU)
3. Go into your Project Ignis folder (If you did not change any setting when installing Edopro, it should be in C:\ProjectIgnis)
4. Place the downloaded file into the "ProjectIgnis\expansions" folder.
5. Alternatively, you can extract it directly to the main "\ProjectIgnis\" folder. 
**If you already have SD images in the "pics" folder, this action will ask to overwrite those images.**
6. Start EDOpro.


Notes:

If you put the zip in repositories, EDO program pulls from the zip by default. Anything new/not in the zip is pulled from EDO low-res image server, and will go into the "\ProjectIgnis\pics" folder. 

**Step #1 is recommended when updating,** in order to remove any SD images you may have downloaded, as the EDO program will display the earliest dated version of the card image when there are duplicates. ***This also ensures deletion of images with no longer valid card IDs, as IDs change from unnofficial to official.***
